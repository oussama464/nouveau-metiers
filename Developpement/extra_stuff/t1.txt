---------------------------
# create the training dataset by grouing on the job_id 
and preserving the year order 
the dataset will be similar to [job_id, [rowprop2015 ,row_pop2016,rowpop....],is_emerging_job]

# apply the fourier transform 
# apply other transforms 
----------------------------
#apply moving avrage smoothing on tse before feature extraction 
# apply feature reduction:
    1- feature selection: perform one way ANOVA for evry feature and the output  shoosing the top F1 score 
    2- apply PCA  principle componnent analysis


----------------------------
# train a bunch of other classifiers 
# try ridge regression as in the paper to predict groth 
# try logitic regression to classify
